While funding can only be granted to States, individuals or groups (for example counties or conservation organizations) may work with a State agency that has a cooperative agreement on conservation efforts that are mutually beneficial, as a subgrantee.To be eligible for consideration, applicants must seek funding to conduct conservation work on federally listed resident species currently included in the State&quot;s section 6 cooperative agreement. States may also apply for funding to monitor any species that has become a candidate or eligible unlisted species by the application deadline or has been delisted due to recovery within the last five years.Projects must involve voluntary conservation efforts within the United States. Projects within a grant must be consistent with approved or draft species recovery plans. In no case will proposed work be in conflict with approved recovery plans [50 CFR 81.2].A permit from the Regional Director may be required if a project within a grant involves taking, transporting across State lines, introduction into an area beyond its historical range, or holding wildlife in captivity for more than 45 days. If you anticipate any of these activities, you must submit an Environmental Assessment to the Regional Director before we will grant a permit [50 CFR 81.9, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)].Neither the Federal funds awarded through this Funding Opportunity, nor the associated non-Federal cost share, may be used to satisfy regulatory requirements of the ESA, including complying with a biological opinion under section 7, fulfilling Federal mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring requirements of a habitat conservation plan permitted under section 10, or any other Federal regulatory mitigation requirement (e.g., mitigation for Clean Water Act permits).An application cannot include FWS Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) costs.State administrative costs must either be assumed by the State or included in the proposal in accordance with Federal requirements.Generally, only expenses incurred and budgeted during the period of performance are reimbursable; the period of performance begins with the effective date established at the time the grant is approved.

Pre-award costs are those incurred prior to the approval of the grant where such costs are necessary to comply with the proposed period of performance. Such costs are allowable only if the grant is awarded, only to the extent that they would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the award, and only with the written approval of the awarding agency (2 CFR 200.458).Applications may address new or ongoing species conservation work.

States may also apply for funding to monitor any species that has become a candidate or eligible unlisted species by the application deadline or has been delisted due to recovery within the last five years.Projects must involve voluntary conservation efforts within the United States. Projects within a grant must be consistent with approved or draft species recovery plans. In no case will proposed work be in conflict with approved recovery plans [50 CFR 81.2].A permit from the Regional Director may be required if a project within a grant involves taking, transporting across State lines, introduction into an area beyond its historical range, or holding wildlife in captivity for more than 45 days. If you anticipate any of these activities, you must submit an Environmental Assessment to the Regional Director before we will grant a permit [50 CFR 81.9, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)].Neither the Federal funds awarded through this Funding Opportunity, nor the associated non-Federal cost share, may be used to satisfy regulatory requirements of the ESA, including complying with a biological opinion under section 7, fulfilling Federal mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring requirements of a habitat conservation plan permitted under section 10, or any other Federal regulatory mitigation requirement (e.g., mitigation for Clean Water Act permits).An application cannot include FWS Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) costs.State administrative costs must either be assumed by the State or included in the proposal in accordance with Federal requirements.Generally, only expenses incurred and budgeted during the period of performance are reimbursable; the period of performance begins with the effective date established at the time the grant is approved. However, a State may request reimbursement of pre-award costs for certain necessary expenses detailed in the grant application. Pre-award costs are those incurred prior to the approval of the grant where such costs are necessary to comply with the proposed period of performance. Such costs are allowable only if the grant is awarded, only to the extent that they would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the award, and only with the written approval of the awarding agency (2 CFR 200.458).Applications may address new or ongoing species conservation work. Projects supporting ongoing work in which the scope, objectives, and expected outcomes remain consistent over time are considered continuation projects. Applications for continuation projects must include a brief discussion of accomplishments to date and a justification for the continuation in the Project Narrative.Land acquisition is not eligible for consideration under this Funding Opportunity.",

    "eligibility": "Only State agencies that have entered into a cooperative agreement with FWS pursuant to section 6(c) of the ESA or enters into/reconfirms such an agreement within 30 days of the application deadline are eligible to apply under this Funding Opportunity. FWS requires a complete, signed cooperative agreement before it can obligate Federal funds to a project [50 CFR 81.3, 50 CFR 81.5, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)]. While funding can only be granted to States, individuals or groups (for example counties or conservation organizations) may work with a State agency that has a cooperative agreement on conservation efforts that are mutually beneficial, as a subgrantee.To be eligible for consideration, applicants must seek funding to conduct conservation work on federally listed resident species currently included in the State&quot;s section 6 cooperative agreement. States may also apply for funding to monitor any species that has become a candidate or eligible unlisted species by the application deadline or has been delisted due to recovery within the last five years.Projects must involve voluntary conservation efforts within the United States. Projects within a grant must be consistent with approved or draft species recovery plans. In no case will proposed work be in conflict with approved recovery plans [50 CFR 81.2].A permit from the Regional Director may be required if a project within a grant involves taking, transporting across State lines, introduction into an area beyond its historical range, or holding wildlife in captivity for more than 45 days. If you anticipate any of these activities, you must submit an Environmental Assessment to the Regional Director before we will grant a permit [50 CFR 81.9, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)].Neither the Federal funds awarded through this Funding Opportunity, nor the associated non-Federal cost share, may be used to satisfy regulatory requirements of the ESA, including complying with a biological opinion under section 7, fulfilling Federal mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring requirements of a habitat conservation plan permitted under section 10, or any other Federal regulatory mitigation requirement (e.g., mitigation for Clean Water Act permits).An application cannot include FWS Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) costs.State administrative costs must either be assumed by the State or included in the proposal in accordance with Federal requirements.Generally, only expenses incurred and budgeted during the period of performance are reimbursable; the period of performance begins with the effective date established at the time the grant is approved.

    "eligibility": "Only State agencies that have entered into a cooperative agreement with FWS pursuant to section 6(c) of the ESA or enters into/reconfirms such an agreement within 30 days of the application deadline are eligible to apply under this Funding Opportunity. FWS requires a complete, signed cooperative agreement before it can obligate Federal funds to a project [50 CFR 81.3, 50 CFR 81.5, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)]. While funding can only be granted to States, individuals or groups (for example counties or conservation organizations) may work with a State agency that has a cooperative agreement on conservation efforts that are mutually beneficial, as a subgrantee.To be eligible for consideration, applicants must seek funding to conduct conservation work on federally listed resident species currently included in the State&quot;s section 6 cooperative agreement. States may also apply for funding to monitor any species that has become a candidate or eligible unlisted species by the application deadline or has been delisted due to recovery within the last five years.Projects must involve voluntary conservation efforts within the United States. Projects within a grant must be consistent with approved or draft species recovery plans. In no case will proposed work be in conflict with approved recovery plans [50 CFR 81.2].A permit from the Regional Director may be required if a project within a grant involves taking, transporting across State lines, introduction into an area beyond its historical range, or holding wildlife in captivity for more than 45 days. If you anticipate any of these activities, you must submit an Environmental Assessment to the Regional Director before we will grant a permit [50 CFR 81.9, 43 CFR 12.50(b)(3)].Neither the Federal funds awarded through this Funding Opportunity, nor the associated non-Federal cost share, may be used to satisfy regulatory requirements of the ESA, including complying with a biological opinion under section 7, fulfilling Federal mitigation, minimization, and/or monitoring requirements of a habitat conservation plan permitted under section 10, or any other Federal regulatory mitigation requirement (e.g., mitigation for Clean Water Act permits).An application cannot include FWS Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) costs.State administrative costs must either be assumed by the State or included in the proposal in accordance with Federal requirements.Generally, only expenses incurred and budgeted during the period of performance are reimbursable; the period of performance begins with the effective date established at the time the grant is approved. However, a State may request reimbursement of pre-award costs for certain necessary expenses detailed in the grant application. Pre-award costs are those incurred prior to the approval of the grant where such costs are necessary to comply with the proposed period of performance. Such costs are allowable only if the grant is awarded, only to the extent that they would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the award, and only with the written approval of the awarding agency (2 CFR 200.458).Applications may address new or ongoing species conservation work.

Within the AFRPS Maintenance funding track only, an applicant may apply to the Mutual Reliance funding option, provided they meet the funding option eligibility criteria (below).Applicants are encouraged to apply for cooperative agreement assistance that reflects their jurisdiction&apos;s needs in terms of amounts of funding and number of project years.To ascertain an applicant&apos;s tier funding level, please consult Section II.

Applicants may request up to $300,000 per year for this funding track. State programs will move to AFRPS Maintenance funding levels in the sixth year of funding under AFRPS cooperative agreements. Applicants with less than five (5) years of funding under a past AFRPS cooperative agreement may elect to count years of AFRPS enrollment under the FDA Animal Food Safety Inspection Contract toward the five (5) years AFRPS funding eligibility requirement when determining the entry date for Funding Track 2 (AFRPS Maintenance Phase), and may elect to move to Funding Track 2 (AFRPS Maintenance Phase) for the award year after full implementation of the AFRPS has been achieved (as determined by an assessment by FDA Audit Staff).Funding Track 2: AFRPS Maintenance PhaseApplicants must have received five (5) years of funding under a past AFRPS cooperative agreement.

This approach establishes funding levels proportional to the applicant&apos;s jurisdictional work volume and costs for this program area. To determine which funding level is applicable to your program, please consult the table below. Applicants are encouraged to apply for cooperative agreement assistance that reflects their jurisdiction&apos;s needs both in terms of amounts of funding and number of project years.Funding Track 3 (Optional): Mutual RelianceApplicants must be recognized as being in full implementation by the FDA audit staff prior to the time of application.",

There is no regulation prohibiting an FFRDC from responding to a solicitation issued under this MAA. However, the FFRDC&apos;s sponsoring agency must first make a determination that the effort being proposed falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the FFRDC, and that determination must be included in the FFRDC&apos;s proposal. In addition, AFRL must make a determination that the work proposed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry. Only after these determinations are made, would a determination be made concerning the FFRDC&apos;s eligibility to receive an award. Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Contracting Officer identified in the solicitation before deciding to respond.

A Track 1 investigator must demonstrate a decrease in one or more metrics. A Track 2 investigator must demonstrate a lack of activity in all three metrics in the new area of interest (publications and funding in other areas are allowed). Examples of acceptable documentation of these metrics include: a full curriculum vitae with all publications and funding activity, a budget balance sheet showing funds from current awards are fully committed, a lack of support for research staff, reviews from a proposal saying preliminary data is needed, declined seed grant proposal from home institution, a lack of access to a necessary collaborator. Other metrics and means for documentation of the metric may be considered, after consultation with a RARE program director.

    "eligibility": "*Who May Submit Proposals: Proposals may only be submitted by the following: -Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs): Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the US, acting on behalf of their faculty members. Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of sub-awards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus. *Who May Serve as PI: Investigators must contact a RARE program director to confirm eligibility prior to submission. The investigator will receive an e-mail confirmation of eligibility, which must be uploaded as a Single Copy document with the proposal submission. The investigator must hold a PhD in engineering or a closely related discipline, with prior research experiences in an area within the scope of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. Application to the RARE program is not limited by demographics. Tenured or tenure-track faculty may apply. Adjunct, affiliated, research, or teaching faculty may apply if they are employed either full or part-time by an academic institution, provided they have a plan to seek future employment on the tenure-track. Other qualified individuals who lack University affiliation may apply, provided they have identified a senior research mentor at a University; in this select case, the mentor may serve as PI(see &lsquo;Additional Eligibility&rsquo; information below). Investigators that have previously received a RARE award are ineligible for a second award. PIs that are eligible for a CAREER submission are ineligible for a RARE submission. Proposals from investigatorswho have had no change in career status for an extended period of time are encouraged. The RARE investigator must demonstrate a substantial decrease in research metrics that result from the research hiatus to receive a confirmation of eligibility.The metrics must be communicated to a RARE program director to receive an e-mail confirmation of eligibility. Also, full documentation of these metrics should be included in a full curriculum vitae that is uploaded as a Single Copy document with the proposal. Applicable research metrics include: (1) research publication activity; (2) external research support as PI or co-PI, at a funding level that is consistent with a typical CBET individual investigator award; (3) resources with which to collect preliminary data. A Track 1 investigator must demonstrate a decrease in one or more metrics. A Track 2 investigator must demonstrate a lack of activity in all three metrics in the new area of interest (publications and funding in other areas are allowed). Examples of acceptable documentation of these metrics include: a full curriculum vitae with all publications and funding activity, a budget balance sheet showing funds from current awards are fully committed, a lack of support for research staff, reviews from a proposal saying preliminary data is needed, declined seed grant proposal from home institution, a lack of access to a necessary collaborator. Other metrics and means for documentation of the metric may be considered, after consultation with a RARE program director. The curriculum vitae should be formatted such that a decline in the research metrics is clearly indicated, for example, by separating entries into pre- and post-stagnation periods. In cases where the curriculum vitae may be unclear or ambiguous, the investigator should discuss the metrics with the RARE program director during the initial eligibility discussion. Track 2 proposals from an investigator with an active NSF award are discouraged.",

Other members of the S-STEM project senior leadership and management team may be listed as Co-Principal Investigators or as Principal Investigators on collaborative research proposals. Collaborative Planning grants are intended to help a collection of institutions plan for a future Inter-institutional Track 3 proposal. For Collaborative Planning grants, the Principal Investigator must be (a) a faculty member teaching in any S-STEM eligible discipline, or (b) a STEM administrator (department head or above) at one of the institutions within the envisioned inter-institutional consortia, or (c) a non-teaching institutional, educational, or social science researcher investigating questions related to low-income student success. The Principal Investigator on a Collaborative Planning grant must demonstrate the capacity to convene and lead a team of inter-institutional S-STEM eligible faculty, social science or educational researchers, and administrators focused on low-income student success to write the desired proposal in a 1-year timeframe.",
